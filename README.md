**This repository stores all the source codes and implementation of the FlightScanner project.***
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flight Scanner is a search engine application that gives the user detailed real-time data about different available flights. The program is developed in Android Studio with Java.

It has features such as:
1. Users can create accounts and sign in to their accounts if they already have one.
2. Getting more personalized information, personal usage and history record of their previous bookings within their profile.
3. The ability to search from thousands of airlines with reading time data from one city to another city and getting a list of flights with the ability to filter based on price, airlines, number of transits and more.

Here are some of the current User interfaces of the application:
